This module introduces object-oriented programming in Python through a sequence of exercises built around a shared garden-based model. The theme provides visual continuity, while the technical focus is on developing structured abstractions, controlling state, and organizing interacting components.

Each exercise expands on the previous one, encouraging incremental refinement of program design. By the final stage, these concepts are integrated into a coordinated system managing collections of objects and performing analytical operations over them.

The emphasis throughout the module is clarity of structure, responsibility separation, and maintainability — skills that extend beyond Python into general software architecture.

## 🌿 Core Concepts — Learning Progression

The concepts below appear in the order they are encountered throughout the exercises.

| **Stage** | ⭐️ **Concept** | **Description** |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| ex0 | Program Execution Flow | Understanding script execution order and entry-point structure |
| ex1 | Class Construction | Defining objects as reusable data abstractions |
| ex2 | Methods & State Mutation | Modeling behavior that modifies internal state |
| ex3 | Object Collections | Managing and iterating across multiple instances |
| ex4 | Validation & Encapsulation | Enforcing constraints and protecting object integrity |
| ex5 | Inheritance Hierarchies | Reusing and extending functionality through specialization |
| ex6 | System Composition | Coordinating multiple components into an organized architecture |
| ex6 | Method Typing | Applying instance, class, and static methods appropriately |
| ex6 | Nested Components | Embedding analytical helpers within management systems |

## 🌸 Module Takeaway

CodeCultivation represents a transition from procedural scripting toward architectural thinking. The exercises encourage reasoning about relationships between components, lifecycle management, and structural clarity as complexity grows.

These patterns establish the structural intuition needed for larger Python systems and subsequent architecture-heavy projects in the curriculum.
