This module introduces **error handling and defensive programming** in Python through a sequence of exercises focused on building resilient systems.

The exercises simulate real-world data processing scenarios where programs must handle unexpected situations gracefully. Rather than preventing failures entirely, the goal is to design systems that remain stable, recover from errors, and maintain data integrity.

Each exercise progressively expands the program's ability to detect, handle, and communicate errors clearly. By the final stage, these techniques are combined into a complete management system that continues operating even when problems occur.

The emphasis throughout the module is robustness, fault tolerance, and predictable program behavior.

## 🌿 Core Concepts — Learning Progression

The concepts below appear in the order they are encountered throughout the exercises.

| **Stage** | ⭐️ **Concept** | **Description** |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| ex0 | Exception Handling Basics | Using `try` / `except` to handle invalid input and prevent crashes |
| ex1 | Built-in Exception Types | Understanding and handling different Python error categories |
| ex2 | Custom Exceptions | Creating domain-specific error classes through inheritance |
| ex3 | Cleanup with `finally` | Ensuring resource cleanup regardless of errors |
| ex4 | Raising Errors | Detecting invalid states and signaling problems using `raise` |
| ex5 | Integrated Error Handling | Combining validation, custom exceptions, and recovery strategies |

## 🌸 Module Takeaway

*Garden Guardian* develops the ability to design programs that behave reliably in unpredictable situations. The exercises introduce structured error handling, clear failure reporting, and resource safety.

These principles form the foundation of resilient software systems and prepare the transition from basic program structure toward fault-tolerant system design.
