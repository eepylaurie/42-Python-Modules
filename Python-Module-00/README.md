This module introduces Python programming fundamentals through a sequence of small, focused functions built around community garden scenarios. The exercises emphasize understanding syntax, data handling, and control flow rather than building large systems.

Each task targets a specific language feature, encouraging precision in input/output handling and incremental development of computational thinking. The module builds foundational habits in readability, structured logic, and step-wise reasoning — all essential for later abstraction-heavy work.

Throughout the module, emphasis is placed on:

- direct interaction with user input
- predictable execution flow
- clear transformation of data into output
- disciplined function-level structure

These foundations support the transition toward structured programming and object-oriented design in later modules.

## 🌿 Core Concepts — Learning Progression

The concepts below follow the order encountered in the exercises.

| **Stage** | ⭐️ **Concept** | **Description** |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| ex0 | Function Definition | Writing a basic Python function and producing console output |
| ex1 | Input Handling & Arithmetic | Capturing user input, type conversion, performing calculations |
| ex2 | Variable Storage & Aggregation | Storing multiple values and combining results |
| ex3 | Conditional Logic | Branching execution using decision statements |
| ex4 | Boolean Evaluation | Producing different outputs based on state checks |
| ex5 | Iteration vs Recursion | Repeating behavior through loops and recursive calls |
| ex6 | Data Formatting | Combining inputs into structured output summaries |
| ex7 | Type Annotations | Introducing static typing hints and parameter clarity |

These exercises reflect the module’s goal of exploring Python’s **syntax and semantics through garden-data scenarios**, building from expressions and variables toward structured logic and typing.

## 🌸 Module Takeaway

Growing Code establishes the mental model required for programming:

- transforming input into deterministic output
- structuring logic clearly and predictably
- reasoning about program state and execution paths

While technically simple, the module reinforces discipline in writing minimal, focused functions and understanding every instruction executed — a prerequisite for scaling into larger and more abstract systems.

These patterns form the groundwork for future modules involving data structures, object-oriented design, and architectural composition.
